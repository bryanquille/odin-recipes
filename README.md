This is the Project Recipes from The Odin Project course

On this project I have used all the concepts and elements I have been learning through the course as text elements, lists, links, images, and not less important the HTML Boilerplate.

I present 3 recipes with the reference from the page I got them, and also I added a link to back the Homepage Odin Recipes.

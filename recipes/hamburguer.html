    <h1>Hamburguer</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hamburger is a sandwich consisting of a cooked meat patty on a bun or roll. You can order a hamburger, fries, and a shake at most fast food restaurants.</p>
    <p>Hamburgers are traditionally made with ground beef and served with onions, tomatoes, lettuce, ketchup, and other garnishes.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef (80% to 85% lean)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 to 6 hamburger buns, split</li>
        <li>Butter or oil, for the pan</li>
        <li>4 to 6 slices cheese, such as cheddar, swiss, American, or provolone (optional)</li>
        <li>Burger toppings: sliced tomatoes, sliced onions, lettuce, ketchup, mustard, BBQ sauce, pickles, relish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Divide the ground beef. Divide the ground beef into 4 or 6 portions, depending on the number of burgers you would like to make.</li>
        <li>Shape the patties. Gently press each portion of ground beef into a disk about 1-inch thick. Press the middle to create a shallow "dimple" and pat the edges into a round — the patty should look like a frisbee and be slightly larger than your burger buns. Don't worry if there are some cracks in the edges; try not to mash the beef too much as you shape the patties.</li>
        <li>Warm the pan. Heat a pat of butter or a teaspoon of oil in a griddle or large skillet over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Toast the buns. Working in batches if needed, place the bun halves cut-side down in the warm butter or oil. Toast until the surface is golden-brown. Transfer the toasted buns to a serving plate.</li>
        <li>Increase the heat to medium-high. Increase the heat to medium-high, and keep a careful eye on the pan. When you see the first wisp of smoke, you're ready to cook the burgers.</li>
        <li>Cook the burgers for 3 to 5 minutes. Place the burger patties in the hot pan, leaving a little space between each one. Work in batches if necessary. The burgers should sizzle on contact — if they don't, nudge the heat up a little. Generously season with salt and pepper, and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the burgers and cook another 3 to 5 minutes. Quickly slide a spatula under the burgers and flip to the other side. You should see a dark brown sear on the underside — if not, increase your heat next time. Season the other side generously with salt and pepper, and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes to your preferred doneness. If the burger falls apart when you flip, just press the edges together and carry on — your burger will still be great!</li>
        <li>To make cheeseburgers. If making cheeseburgers, top the burgers with cheese as soon as you flip them. If the cheese isn't melting fast enough, cover the pan with a lid or other dome to encourage the cheese to melt.</li>
        <li>Finish the burgers. When the burgers have finished cooking, transfer them to the toasted buns and finish with your favorite burger toppings.</li>
